I would use agents mainly as a way to better understand and support the field service ecosystem rather than just automate tasks. For example, agents could help identify and organize companies, solutions, and trends from conferences and events, and then connect those insights back to real problems field service teams face, like improving technician efficiency or using AI more effectively. This would make it easier to engage with companies and community members in a more informed and relevant way, instead of generic outreach. Over time, these agents could help surface patterns and insights that are useful for both vendors and practitioners, making the overall field service community more connected and data-driven.
